The c-efi project provides the protocol constants and definitions of
the UEFI Reference Specification as native C11 code. The scope of this
project is limited to those protocol definitions. The protocols are not
actually implemented. As such, this project serves as base for any UEFI
application that needs to interact with UEFI, or implement (parts of)
the UEFI specification.

Additionally to providing a C library, this project also serves as
documentation base for UEFI programming in C. It provides
target-triples for UEFI, bootstrap helpers, and a bunch of
documentation how to get started.
