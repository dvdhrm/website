The *c-bus1* project provides access to the bus1 APIs from standard C code. The
bus1 APIs implement object-oriented Inter-Process Communication in a scalable
way for services and operating system tasks to share signals, data, and
resources, while at the same time providing maximum isolation of the different
communication entities.
